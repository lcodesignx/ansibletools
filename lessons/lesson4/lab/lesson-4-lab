# Lesson 4 Lab

1. Create an Ansible configuration that sets up hosts Ansible1 and Ansible2 for automatic
   installation. Create custom facts for both hosts and use variable inclusion to realize
   this. To configure ansible1, use a host group with the name "file", to configure ansible2,
   use a host group with the name "lamp".

2. Create a file with the name custom.fact that defines custom facts. In this file, define
   two sections. The section package contains the following:
   smb_package = smb
   ftp_package = ftp
   db_package = mariadb
   web_package = http
   The section service contains service variables for the packages mentioned aboved. Use
   the name smb_service, etc. and set the variable to the appriopriate name of the service

3. Create a playbook with the name copy_facts.yml that copies these facts to all managed
   hosts. Define a variable with the name "remote_dir" and a variable with the name 
   "fact_file" and use these. Use the file and copy modules

4. Run the playbook and verify it worked
